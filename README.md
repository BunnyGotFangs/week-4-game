JQuery Homework Assignment Week 4


WHAT THE PROJECT DOES:

The Star Wars RPG game is a simple select and attach game. It is a one person game against the computer (the enemy). 

The game is designed to have simple mechanics to allow for any person to easily test their game of skill and chance. 


WHY IT IS USEFUL:

The use of Star Wars RPG, is one designed to allow for a brief moment or two of relaxation away from the the trenches of Coding Boot Camp. Tired of listening to your instructor ramble on about java this or java that, or perhaps your eyes are burning from staring at a screen of code that has just been introduced and it is jumbled in your brain, well this is where Star Wars RPG, comes in. LET OUT YOUR FRUSTRATION by playing a mindless game of Stars Wars RPG. The only thing you have to determine is if you are are feeling lucky punk. 


START FROM HERE: 

To get started with the game, it is quite simple follow the steps below:
    1. Select your player, by clicking on one of the four characters on the screen.
            -   Once you select your character it will move to the Battle Area of       the screen. 
            -   As your player moves to the battle area, it will recieve a randomly     generated starting health seen in the light box.
    2. Select your enemy by clicking on of the three remaining characters at the       top of the screen.
            -   Once you select you enemy it will move to the Battle Area of the        screen.
            -   As your enemy moves to the battle area, it will recieve a randomly     generated starting health seen in the dark box.
    3. To choose different characters, simple refresh your browser and follow steps    1 and 2. 
    4. The battle begins once you select the red ATTACK NOW button on the battle       area of the screen.
            -   Each time you select the ATTACK NOW, the game will determine a          winner for the attack and blast score randomly.
            -   If you are chosen as the winner for the attack, the your enemy's        health will decrease by the random blast.
            -   Conversely, if your enemy wins the attack, then your health will        descrease by the by the random blast.
    5. The first player to have their health depleted (reduced to 0) is the LOOSER!
    6. To reset the game and play again, simply refresh your browser.        

Good luck and "MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!"
